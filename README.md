# The_Game_Description
A program to play the game of Battleship against the computer. This simplified version of the game will be played on a single 8 by 8 grid. 
Before the actual game, each player secretly places 6 ships and 4 grenades on the grid. 
Ships and grenades are a single position on the grid. 
The position of these ships and grenades are of course hidden from the opponent.
Once both players have placed their ships and grenades, the actual game starts.
Each player, in turn, “shoots a rocket” on the grid (i.e. calls a position). The goal of the game is to sink all of your opponent’s ships before your opponent sinks yours.

- If the rocket (the position called) falls on a position where there is nothing, then nothing happens, and the other player can shoot his/her rocket.
- If the rocket falls on a coordinate where the opponent (or the player) has a grenade, then the player loses a turn, and next time, the opponent will play twice in a row.
- If the rocket falls on a coordinate where the opponent (or the player...) has a ship, then that ship sinks.
- If the rocket falls on a coordinate that has been called before, regardless of what was there before, nothing happens. (So, for example, a grenade can only explode once).
